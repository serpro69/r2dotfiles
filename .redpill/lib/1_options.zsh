setopt TRANSIENT_RPROMPT


# ===== Changing Directories
# Make cd push the old directory onto the directory stack
setopt AUTO_PUSHD
# swapped the meaning of cd +1 and cd -1; we want them to mean the opposite of what they mean im csh
setopt PUSHDMINUS
# don’t push multiple copies of the same directory onto the directory stack
setopt PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
# if argument to cd is the name of a parameter whose value is a valid directory, it will become the current directory
setopt CDABLEVARS

# do not print the directory stack after pushd or popd
unsetopt PUSHD_SILENT
# if a command is not in the hash table, and there exists an executable directory by that name, perform the cd command to that directory

setopt EXTENDED_GLOB


# ===== History
# Allow multiple terminal sessions to all append to one zsh command history

setopt EXTENDED_HISTORY
# Add commands as they are typed, don't wait until shell exit
setopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY
# If the internal history needs to be trimmed to add the current command line, setting this option will cause the oldest history event that has a duplicate to be lost before losing a unique event
setopt HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST

setopt ALWAYS_TO_END
